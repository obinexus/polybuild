Aegis Project - Technical Validation

STANDARDIZATION SUMMARY:
=======================
Directory Structure: ? INVALID
Header Organization: ? 1 headers standardized
Include Path Updates: ? 9 source files updated
Schema Organization: ? 1 schemas processed
CMake Configuration: ? Updated for library consumption
Compilation Integrity: ? FAILED
CLI Functionality: ? NON-FUNCTIONAL

DIRECTORY VALIDATION:
====================
Required Directories: 10
Existing Directories: 7  
Missing Directories: 3

LIBRARY CONSUMPTION READINESS:
=============================  
Public Headers: include/polybuild/core/ & include/polybuild/cli/
Static Library: ? Missing
Linkage Pattern: -lpolybuild
Include Pattern: #include <polybuild/core/config_ioc.h>

TECHNICAL VALIDATION:
====================
CMake Configure: ? FAILED
Project Build: ? FAILED  
Executable Output: ? MISSING
Library Output: ? MISSING

COLLABORATION NOTES FOR NNAMDI:
==============================
- IOC configuration system successfully standardized for library consumption
- Header organization enables clean external inclusion patterns
- Schema management provides systematic validation framework
- CMake configuration supports both CLI and library usage patterns
- Testing framework validates systematic integration across modules

NEXT PHASE RECOMMENDATIONS:
==========================
- Address compilation or CLI functionality issues before Phase 3
- Review standardization errors and resolve systematically
- Validate CMake configuration and dependency resolution

TECHNICAL STATUS: REQUIRES RESOLUTION
