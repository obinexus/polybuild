# PolyBuild Architecture Overview

PolyBuild is a polymorphic build orchestration system designed to provide advanced build management capabilities across heterogeneous technology stacks. This document outlines the core architectural components and their relationships.

## Core Components

### DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)

The DAG component provides the foundational structure for representing dependencies and build relationships. It allows for complex dependency chains while ensuring that no circular dependencies exist.

Key features:
- Nodes represent build targets or resources
- Edges represent dependencies with weighted importance
- Resolution algorithm determines build order
- State propagation ensures consistent builds

### Trie

The Trie component provides efficient pattern matching and rule organization capabilities. It enables rapid lookup of build rules and pattern-based configuration.

Key features:
- Regular expression pattern matching
- Hierarchical organization of rules
- Efficient prefix-based lookup
- Taxonomy categorization

### Integration Layer

The integration layer connects different components together, allowing for seamless interaction between the DAG dependency representation and the Trie pattern matching system.

## Topology

PolyBuild supports multiple network topologies for distributed builds:

- **P2P (Peer-to-Peer)**: Direct connections between build nodes
- **Bus**: Central coordination bus
- **Star**: Central hub with radiating connections
- **Ring**: Connected in a circular pattern
- **Mesh**: Fully connected network

## Extension System

The extension system allows for plugins and bindings to expand functionality:

- Plugin API for adding new capabilities
- Binding system for language-specific integration
- Schema-driven configuration
